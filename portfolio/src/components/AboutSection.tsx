      <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
        <p>
          I’m Anthony Grippi — a thoughtful and tenacious recent Computer
          Science graduate with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I enjoy
          exploring how systems break so I can build them better, and I thrive
          in environments that challenge both my technical skills and
          creativity. Outside of development, I’m someone who values learning,
          mentorship, and meaningful collaboration. I’m also deeply curious
          about the intersection of technology, security, and public impact —
          often thinking about how systems shape human behavior. On the
          technical side, I’ve spent years sharpening my backend skills, and
          recently, as my skills have evolved, I’ve gravitated more toward the
          security side of software engineering—where architecture meets
          adversarial thinking. I’ve explored areas like authentication systems,
          network security, and application hardening, and have built practical
          experience using tools such as Burp Suite, Metasploit, and Wireshark.
          Whether I’m securing API integrations, working with OAuth 2.0, or
          analyzing system vulnerabilities in a home lab, I’m driven by a desire
          to build systems that are not just functional—but resilient,
          trustworthy, and secure by design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Professionally, I serve as a Senior Developer and Architect at Clarus
          IT Solutions, where I lead cross-functional teams on CRM and
          automation projects—integrating platforms like Microsoft Dynamics 365
          and Power Platform. I take pride in architecting secure, scalable
          systems for enterprise clients across various industries, often
          bridging legacy tech with modern cloud-first solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a security enthusiast at heart, actively pursuing a transition
          into penetration testing. I’ve built a personal home lab, studied
          OWASP vulnerabilities, and completed coursework in cryptography, IDS,
          and secure system design. My hands-on experience spans tools like Burp
          Suite, Metasploit, and Nmap, with recent projects exploring OAuth 2.0,
          custom connectors, and API security in production environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of academics and professional work, I’m a lifelong learner who
          enjoys building automation tools, experimenting with AI, and tackling
          creative side projects—from crafting games with reinforcement learning
          to building integrations between platforms like Jira and Dataverse.
          Whether it's optimizing business workflows or writing clean,
          expressive code, I’m always driven by curiosity, craftsmanship, and
          the pursuit of elegant problem-solving.
